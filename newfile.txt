Brainstorming in order to build over summer:

-Member log in page on site; accessible perhaps on the Contacts Page
--Could create an additional members log in, but might be clunky

-Simple first page to upload file
Figure out FORM GET, where is it being sent or is it server based
--need to ask for tags: what field, interests, specialities, skills, etc.
--make this a requirement?
--is this necessary? perhaps parse these words from the documents (don't think they can be .pdf files though)

-browse files per speciality (as default) - these to be created/generated prior
-and will likely be user-provided
-state graduation year/brother class
-if no objective immediately clear, please state in textbox

* need option to re-submit
* do people want to be able to browse other entries?
* do we want two views? (prospective vs. staffed)

* possiblity to integrate with LI ability to print out paper or turn into PDF!

* or to make this simple (spend less time), just have them email to you. could work on site for other org...
