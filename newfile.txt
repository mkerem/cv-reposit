Brainstorming in order to build over summer:

1. Private area for resumes (for Rodney's project)
2. Feed for jobs (add jobs here + will feed from LinkedIn)

-Member log in page on site; accessible perhaps on the Contacts Page (separate page from currently existing Members Area?)
--Could create an additional members log in, but might be clunky

-Simple first page to upload file
Figure out FORM GET, where is it being sent or is it server based
--need to ask for tags: what field, interests, specialities, skills, etc.
--make this a requirement?
--is this necessary? perhaps parse these words from the documents (don't think they can be .pdf files though)

-browse files per speciality (as default) - these to be created/generated prior
-and will likely be user-provided
-state graduation year/brother class
-if no objective immediately clear, please state in textbox

* need option to re-submit and delete
-- Bootstrap will provide functionality to upload: http://wordpress.org/plugins/bootstrap-for-wordpress/
* also provide ability to confirm submission (look over file to determine if this is what you would like)
* set as private/public (you can choose to have your resume in, but no one can look at it unless they specifically
email you to take a look)
* work with Fundraising person to work on Rodney's project in order to have companies look at their resumes
* do people want to be able to browse other entries?
* do we want two views? (prospective vs. staffed)

* possiblity to integrate with LI ability to print out paper or turn into PDF!
* consider possibility to "billboard" for job postings, though people may prefer to just use Facebook for this
* In fact... Facebook API!!! Is there a way to use tag words that can get filtered into the board? like #job #jobposting #networking
* though it would be a good way to have a database for past internships/jobs, and this could feed into the
Professional page via php

* or to make this simple (spend less time), just have them email to you. could work on site for other org...

Consider http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
for them to upload files

PERFECT! PDF parser, available on github @ http://www.pdfparser.org/

People you need to work with: Fundraising chair, webmaster, president, alumni (goes last). after testing with 5 different resumes in order to make sure 
there aren't problems, then once school starts, have people upload their resumes during chapter. then reach out to
alumni to upload their own and let them know if this new initiative
