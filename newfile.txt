Brainstorming in order to build over summer

-Member log in page on site; accessible perhaps on the Contacts Page
--Could create an additional members log in, but might be clunky

-Simple first page to upload file
--need to ask for tags: what field, interests, specialities, skills, etc.
--make this a requirement?

-browse files per speciality (as default) - these will be created prior

*Ultimate point to allow alumni and members to "silently" help each other in the job arena
