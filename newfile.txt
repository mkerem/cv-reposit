Brainstorming in order to build over summer

-Member log in page on site; accessible perhaps on the Contacts Page
--Could create an additional members log in, but might be clunky

-Simple first page to upload file
--need to ask for tags: what field, interests, specialities, skills, etc.
--make this a requirement?
--is this necessary? perhaps parse these words from the documents (don't think they can .pdf files though)

-browse files per speciality (as default) - these will be created prior
-this will likely be user-provided

* need option to re-submit
* do people want to be able to browse other entries?
* do we want two views? (prospective vs. staffed)
